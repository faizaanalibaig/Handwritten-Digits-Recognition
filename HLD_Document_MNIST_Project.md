### 1. Project Overview
The MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to develop and evaluate machine learning models for accurately classifying handwritten digits (0 to 9) using the MNIST dataset. The project involves creating, training, and comparing various model architectures to achieve optimal digit recognition accuracy.

### 2. Objective
The primary objective is to build robust machine learning models capable of recognizing and categorizing handwritten digits into their respective classes. The project also aims to compare the performance of different model architectures to identify the most accurate classifier.

### 3. Architecture and Components
The project comprises multiple machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), with varying architectures. Key components include data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation.

### 4. Data Flow
- **Data Collection:** Utilization of the MNIST dataset, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conversion of images into suitable input format and one-hot encoding of labels.
- **Model Development:** Creation of machine learning models with varying architectures.
- **Model Training:** Training models on the training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy metrics.

### 5. Model Development
Four different machine learning models have been developed, each with distinct architectures and hyperparameters.

### 6. Model Evaluation
